<blockquote>
<li>You can execute as many scripts in an objective action as you want. Make sure, however, that your AI base orderers are producing enough units.<br>
<li>Try to put a few different types of units in your recruit types so they can deal with various threats. <br>
<li>A few small squads are better than a single big one: the squads will get recruited faster, and the base won't get clogged up with idle units.<br>
<li>Try to vary the directions of attack trails so they aren't predictable.<br>
<li>Pacing is everything. Too fast, and the mission becomes impossible; too slow and it can get boring.<br>
<li>The AI needs line of sight to use a Telepad just like a player. If the AI relies on Telepads for transport scripts, make sure it will get line of sight to the destination. Send air units or other scouts to get line of sight, or the squad may never get unloaded.<br>
<li>Use ordinal rankings for important squad scripts to make sure they get executed. <br>
</blockquote>

<font size="3"><b>Scripting Variables</b></font><br>
Each script has a set of variables that are required to execute that script. All scripts are kept in packs\base\configs\ai\scripts. You can look in the specific script for its required variables. It's also worth a look at some of the Dark Reign 2 single player missions for more examples.
