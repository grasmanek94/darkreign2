<H1>Traction Type Configuration</H1>
<BR>
Traction types are on one axis of the movement balance table - the other
axis holds surface types.  The balance data for this table is used by
various systems such as physics and path searching.<BR>

<B>CreateTractionType(string ident)</B><BR>

ident: Identifier of the traction type being configured.<BR>

  <I>Optional(30), Multiple</I><BR>
  slope: The slope to use for subsequent 'OverSurface' functions.<BR>

  <B>OverSurface(string ident, float grip, float drag, float health = 0.0)</B><BR>
  <I>Optional(All non-configured surfaces, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0)</I><BR>
  ident: The identifier of the surface type being configured<BR>
  grip: The grip on this surface, 0.0 to 1.0, where larger is greater grip<BR>
  drag: Same as grip, except for drag :)<BR>
  health: An optional +/- hitpoints modifier for when objects are on this surface.
  (-1.0 to 1.0) Once per cycle (ten times per second) the current hitpoints will be modified by
  health x maxhitpoints.  Whether this is applied to a particular type is determined
  by the ApplyTerrainHealth function in the MapObj scope.

Note: Traction types do not have to be created before they are referenced in
other areas of the configuration.  Whenever you reference a surface or traction
type for the first time, an entry in the table is created.
